# Enhanced Chess Game Application

## Overview

This is a comprehensive desktop chess application built with Python and Tkinter that features local multiplayer, networked multiplayer, and AI gameplay modes. The application implements a complete chess engine with advanced features including real-time networking, time controls, drag-and-drop gameplay, save/load functionality, and an enhanced AI opponent with alpha-beta pruning.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular, object-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Model-View-Controller Pattern**: The chess board logic (model), GUI presentation (view), and game flow control are separated into distinct modules
- **Component-Based Design**: Each chess piece type is implemented as a separate class with shared inheritance
- **State Management**: Centralized game state handling for mode switching and game progression
- **AI Integration**: Pluggable AI system with configurable difficulty levels

## Key Features

### Real-Time Networking (TCP/IP)
- **Peer-to-peer chess games** over network connections
- **Real-time move synchronization** between players
- **Chat functionality** for network games
- **Connection management** with automatic reconnection handling

### Multi-threaded Architecture
- **GUI thread** for user interface responsiveness
- **Network I/O threads** for real-time communication
- **AI computation threads** for non-blocking move calculation
- **Timer threads** for real-time countdown displays

### Enhanced AI System
- **Alpha-Beta pruning** minimax algorithm for stronger play
- **Iterative deepening** for time-bounded move calculation
- **Advanced position evaluation** including material, mobility, and king safety
- **Three difficulty levels**: Easy (random), Medium (evaluation), Hard (minimax with pruning)

### Time Control System
- **Configurable time limits** (Blitz, Rapid, Custom)
- **Increment support** for Fischer-style time controls
- **Real-time countdown timers** with visual indicators
- **Automatic game termination** on time expiry

### Interactive GUI Features
- **Drag-and-drop piece movement** with visual feedback
- **Move highlighting** showing legal moves for selected pieces
- **Enhanced visual design** with color-coded timers and status indicators
- **Save/Load game functionality** with JSON serialization

## Key Components

### Core Game Engine
- **ChessBoard** (`chess_board.py`): Complete chess game logic with move validation and game state management
- **ChessPiece Classes** (`chess_pieces.py`): Object-oriented piece implementations with movement validation
- **GameState** (`game_state.py`): Extended state management for network games, AI settings, and time controls

### Enhanced User Interface
- **EnhancedChessGUI** (`enhanced_chess_gui.py`): Full-featured interface with networking, timers, and drag-and-drop
- **Visual Features**: Real-time timers, chat interface, enhanced move highlighting, and network status indicators

### Network System
- **NetworkManager** (`network_manager.py`): TCP/IP communication handler with JSON message protocol
- **Real-time synchronization** of moves, chat messages, and game state updates

### AI & Time Management
- **ChessAI** (`chess_ai.py`): Enhanced AI with alpha-beta pruning and advanced evaluation heuristics
- **GameTimer** (`game_timer.py`): Comprehensive time control system with increment support

### Data Persistence
- **GameSerializer** (`game_serializer.py`): Save/load functionality with JSON format and PGN export capability

### Application Entry
- **Main** (`main.py`): Enhanced application bootstrap with proper cleanup and window management

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Player clicks on board squares through the GUI
2. **Move Validation**: ChessBoard validates moves using piece-specific logic
3. **State Updates**: Successful moves update board state and switch players
4. **AI Processing**: When AI's turn, ChessAI calculates and executes optimal move
5. **Visual Updates**: GUI refreshes to reflect new board state and game status
6. **Game Progression**: GameState tracks moves and manages game modes

## External Dependencies

- **Python Standard Library**:
  - `tkinter`: GUI framework for cross-platform desktop interface
  - `random`: AI move randomization for easy difficulty
  - `threading`: Asynchronous AI move processing
  - `time`: Move timing and delays

- **No external packages required**: The application uses only Python built-in modules for maximum compatibility

## Deployment Strategy

- **Desktop Application**: Standalone Python application requiring Python 3.x runtime
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux through Tkinter
- **Single Executable**: Can be packaged using PyInstaller or similar tools for distribution
- **No Installation Required**: Direct execution from source code
